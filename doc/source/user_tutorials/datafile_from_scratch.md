# Build your data file from scratch

To run a TRUST simulation, all you have to do is write a correctly formatted data file. This is one of the advantages offered by the platform, allowing the user to change, modify, and test calculations without needing to write C++ code or recompile/link with the TRUST library. However, there is a specific syntax that must be respected to ensure that the TRUST interpreter can read the data file correctly and perform the necessary calculations.

**Attention**: TRUST is sensitive to empty spaces. To avoid issues, use an empty space before and after each keyword. For example, **Read_MED{domain dom file Mesh.med}** wont work ! You should write **Read_MED { domain dom file Mesh.med }** (note the spaces before and after the  braces { ... }.

**Attention**: It is possible to write comments in you data file. This can be done by the **#** character; **#** at the begining and at the end of the commented line/paragraph. It is also possible to put your comments between **/*** and ***/**, as the bloc comments in C++. Again, attention to the empty spaces. See these examples

	# THIS IS A COMMENT #
	/* THIS ALSO */
	
	/* THESE
		ARE
		ALSO
		COMMENTS */
		
	# THESE
		TOO
		...
		YES ! #
		
	#THIS IS NOT GOOD! NEED SPACES#
	/*THIS IS BAD TOO*/
	
	// THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE NOOO
	
	# THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE BECAUSE IT IS NOT CLOSED
	
	/* NEITHER IS THIS

In this section, we will recreate step by step the data file you have used in the [](../quick_start.md). We recomment to use the SI units for all quantities (velocity, viscosity, etc...)

## Step 1 : Create an empty data file

Create an empty data file named Obstacle.data in an empty Obstacle repository.

## Step 2 : Create your mesh

Prepare a meshed domain that will be used in the simulation. You can use the [Salome](https://www.salome-platform.org/) software to do so. 

In order to be compliant with this tutorial, you need to name your mesh `Mesh` defined on a domain named `dom` and written in a MED file named `Mesh.med` is used. The MED file should include five boundaries:

- Square: representing the obstacle
- Upper: representing the upper-top boundary
- Lower: representing the lower-bottom boundary
- Inlet: representing the inlet-left boundary
- Outlet: representing the outlet-right boundary

It is important to note the names of all the boundaries because they will need to be specified when imposing boundary conditions. Here is a visualization of the mesh used in the simulation.

<img src="https://github.com/cea-trust-platform/cea-trust-platform.github.io/blob/master/images/simulation/mesh.png?raw=true" alt="Mesh" width="700"/>

Now, you can start constructing your data file.

## Step 3 : Define the domain and read the mesh

You should start by defining the dimension of the domain. In this case it is 2D.

You should create an instance of the `Domaine` class, named dom as that you used in the MED file.

Read the MED file and the mesh using the class `Read_MED`. Since the generated was a bit coarse, TRUST allows you to reffine the mesh if you like to. This can be done via the class `Raffiner_isotrope ` applied to your domain `dom`.

Start by inserting this in Obstacle.data

	# Dimension can be 2D or 3D #
	dimension 2
	
	# Domain definition #
	Domaine dom
	
	# Read the mesh from MED file #
	Read_MED { domain dom file Mesh.med }

	# Refine the mesh to have better results (optional) #
	Raffiner_isotrope dom

## Step 4 : Define the discretization and the problem

The mesh used here allows us to use the VDF discretization. So use the class `VDF` to create an instance with the variable `my_discretisation`.

We will solve just the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations, so its a hydraulic problem. Create an instance of `Pb_hydraulique` and name it `pb`.

Insert this in Obstacle.data 

	# Discretization on rectangles (hexa), so use VDF #
	VDF my_discretisation
	
	# Problem definition #
	Pb_hydraulique pb

## Step 5 : Define the time integration scheme

Its for you to define what time scheme to use. Here, we will use the Euler explicit scheme. For that, we create an instance of `Scheme_euler_explicit`, I called it `my_scheme`, and we read its parameters. 

This bloc contains a lot of parameters, try to read the comments and insert the bloc in Obstacle.data.

	# Define your time scheme; here use explicit #
	Scheme_euler_explicit my_scheme
	Read my_scheme
	{
	    # Initial time [s] #
	    tinit 0
	
	    # Min time step #
	    dt_min 5.e-6
	
	    # Max time step #
	    dt_max 5.e-3
	
	    # facsec such as dt = facsec * min(dt(CFL),dt_max) ; for explicit scheme facsec <= 1. By default facsec equals to 1 #
	    facsec 0.5
	
	    # Output criteria #
	    # .out files printing period #
	    dt_impr 5.e-3 # Note: small value to print at each time step #
	
	    # End time [s] of the simulation #
	    tmax 10.0
	}

## Step 6 : Assosciate the instantiated objects

Now, you need to link the domaine, the discretization and the time scheme to the problem. This is done by the C++ class `Associate` and `Discretize`.

Insert this in Obstacle.data

	# Association between the different objects #
	Associate pb dom /* Assosciate domaine */
	Associate pb my_scheme /* Assosciate time scheme */
	Discretize pb my_discretisation /* Discretize the domain */
	
## Step 7 : Read the problem (medium, equation, BC's, post-processings)

Thats the main point now: define the problem !

Start by defining the incompressible medium `Fluide_incompressible`.

Once done, read the Navier-Stokes equation `Navier_Stokes_standard`. Provide the pressure solver `Solveur_pression` and the spatial scheme to be used for the convection operator (here we use the third order `Quick` scheme). 

Precise the initial and boundary conditions. This is done by the `Initial_conditions` and `Boundary_conditions` keywords. Here, we consider that the fluid is at rest at the initial state; so the velocity field is nul. At the boundaries, we consider a no-slip BC at the obstacle borders and symmetry at the top/bottom walls. At the inlet, we fix the horizontal velocity to 1 m/s, while the pressure is fixed at the outlet (open boundary).

Finaly, ask TRUST to write you the velocity and vorticity fields to visualize ! Thus, create and read a `Post_processing` object.

Try to read carefuly the syntax/comments and insert the bloc in Obstacle.data.

	# Problem description #
	Read pb
	{
	    # Physical characteristcs of medium #
	    Fluide_incompressible 
	    {
	        # Dynamic viscosity [kg/m/s] #
	        mu Champ_Uniforme 1 3.7e-05
	        # Volumic mass [kg/m3] #
	        rho Champ_Uniforme 1 2
	    }
	
	    # NS equation #
	    Navier_Stokes_standard
	    {
	        # Pressure matrix solved with #
	        Solveur_pression PETSc Cholesky { }
	
	        # Solve the convection operator with a 3rd order QUICK scheme #
	        Convection { quick }

	        # Solve the diffusion too; remember diffusion always 2nd order centered #
	        Diffusion { }
	
	        # Uniform initial condition for velocity #
	        Initial_conditions { vitesse Champ_Uniforme 2 0. 0. }
	
	        # Boundary conditions #
	        Boundary_conditions 
	        {
	            Square 	paroi_fixe
	            Upper  	symetrie
	            Lower 	symetrie
	            Outlet 	frontiere_ouverte_pression_imposee Champ_front_Uniforme 1 0.
	            Inlet 	frontiere_ouverte_vitesse_imposee Champ_front_Uniforme 2 1. 0.
	        }
	    }
	
	    # Post_processing description #
	    Post_processing
	    {
	        # Fields #
	        format lata
	        fields dt_post 1.e-2
	        {
	            vitesse som
	            vorticite som
	        }
	    }
	}
	
## Step 8 : Solve the problem 

Now, end your data file by inserting this bloc. This will tell TRUST to run and solve the problem.

	# The problem is solved with #
	Solve pb

Save your Obstacle.data file and run the simulation by doing:

	trust Obstacle.data

## Results 

Now, you can visualize your results! You should see an animation similar to the one shown below! It is the well known Von Karman vortex street!
