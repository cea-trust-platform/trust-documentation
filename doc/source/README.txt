Here, there are two source directories:
- 'srcs': which contains the real source text that you should edit and in which you may use the :code: tags
- '.srcs_processed': which is automatically generated by the documentation script, and in which the replacement of the :code: tags by the real underlying HTML link has been performed.

The last directory should never be edited manually.
