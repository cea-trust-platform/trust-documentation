# Constituents and turbulent flow, with TrioCFD


# TrioCFD Turbulent Flow with Concentration Tutorial

This tutorial demonstrates how to simulate a 2D incompressible turbulent flow with constituent transport using TrioCFD's k-ε model. {numref}`fig:marche` shows the geometry of the test case you will run in this tutorial.

## Problem Setup

### Fluid Properties

| Property  | Value  |
|----------|--------|
| Dynamic viscosity  $μ$ | $3.7 \cdot 10^{-5} kg \cot m^{-1}·s^{-1}$ |
| Density  $ρ$ | 2 $kg \cdot m^{-3} |
| Reynolds number  $Re$ | 54,054   |


### Boundary Conditions

| Location | Velocity | Pressure | k | ε | Notes |
|----------|----------|----------|---|---|-------|
| Inlet | U₀ = 1 m·s⁻¹ | - | 10⁻² | 10⁻³ | Imposed velocity, dimensionless k and ε |
| Outlet | - | P₀ = 0 | 0 | 0 | Constant pressure |
| Top/Bottom walls | U = 0 | - | Standard flux | Null | No-slip condition |

## TRUST and TrioCFD Environment Setup

The open-source TrioCFD software is a Baltik of TRUST. It is therefore based on TRUST. One of the main application of [TrioCFD](https://triocfd.cea.fr/) is turbulent flow modelling. You will need it for this tutorial. Therefore, we will show you how to link your **TRUST** environment to the TrioCFD one.

### Environment Initialization

First, you'll need to install TrioCFD from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cea-trust-platform/TrioCFD-code):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cea-trust-platform/TrioCFD-code.git $MY_TRIOCFD_REPO
cd $MY_TRIOCFD_REPO
source PathToTRUST/env_TRUST.sh
baltik_build_configure -execute
make optim
make debug 
```
Note that you will need to have build **TRUST** in optim and debug.

Verification of the environment setup can be done by checking the environment variables:
```bash
echo $exec
echo $project_directory
```

### Study Template Preparation

The simulation starts by copying the base **Marche** study, which provides a foundation for 2D incompressible turbulent flow using the k-ε model. 

Navigate to your working directory: `$MY_TRUST_TUTORIAL` and execute:

```bash
triocfd -copy Marche
```

Since we'll be working with constituent diffusion, the **Constituants** study also needs to be copied as it demonstrates 2D incompressible laminar flow with constituents:

```bash
triocfd -copy Constituants
```

Documentation access is available through the TrioCFD index system, which provides access to the Reference Manual containing the necessary keywords for problem configuration:

```bash
triocfd -index
```

You can also find those informations in the [TrioCFD Documentation](https://triocfd-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Test Case Implementation

### Problem Configuration and Constituent Setup

First, open the `Marche.data` file. 

The data file modification begins by renaming the problem to accommodate concentration equations. 

Check the TrioCFD Reference Manual to find the appropriate keywords. 

Then, add 3 constituents of equal diffusivities ($\alpha = 1 m \cdot s ^{-1}$) in the block problem after the fluid definition)

Define the concentration equation into the problem with the correct initial ($C_1 = C_2 = C_3 = 0) and boundary conditions.
Remember that concentrations are a vectors of 3 components.

Use the Schmidt model to close the turbulence model in the concentration equation

### Turbulence Model Modification

Chage the Navier-Stokes turbulence model to an anisotropic concentration-coupled version: **Source_Transport_K_Eps_aniso_concen { C1_eps 1.44 C2_eps 1.92 C3_eps 1. }**


This modification ensures proper coupling between the flow field and concentration transport. 

Additionally, the fluid definition must include a volume expansion coefficient for concentration (`beta_co`) set as a uniform field equal to 0, along with a gravity field initialized to 0.

### Initial Validation and Sub-domain Definition

Try to run your update test case:
```bash
triocfd marche
```

Now, you will define the sub domain in grey in {numref}`fig:marche`. 

To do so, you will need to use the **Sous_Zone** keyword. To find an example of the **Sous_Zone** keyword usage, run the following:
```bash
trust -search Sous_Zone
```
It will give you tha list of **TRUST** test cases that use this keyword. You can for example edit the `PCR.data` file of the PCR test case.  

### Source Term Implementation


The second constituent requires a specific source term (S₂ = 1 m⁻³) applied exclusively to the defined sub-domain. This implementation uses the `Champ_Uniforme_Morceaux` keyword to ensure spatial localization of the source effects.

### Post-processing and run

Now, add a source term for the second constituent only ($S_2 = 1 m^{-3}) applied on the sub domain thanks to the keyword **Champ_Uniforme_Morceaux**.

Change post-processing format to lata in the post-processing block.

Add the keywords **concentration0**, **concentration1**, **concentration2** in the fields of the post-processing block to write the 3 concentrations into the .lata file.

Run the calculation:
```bash
triocfd marche
```

And check the results with Visit. You will be able to see the different concentrations.
