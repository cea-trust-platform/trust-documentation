## Spatial schemes

The spatial discretization of each term in a given equation is carried out in the TRUST platform by whjat we call the **operators** (operators for convective terms, diffusion, gradient, divergence, ...) It is important to keep in mind that all these operators are **dependent** of the employed discretization; in particular on the variables localisation.

In the platform TRUST, all operators derive from the base class `Operateur_base`. Click **[here](https://cea-trust-platform.github.io/TRUST_Doxygen.github.io/html/classOperateur__base.html)** to see the Doxygen documentation of this class.

In what follows, the available convective operator schemes are summarized.

**Attention:** The diffusion term is more or less a Laplacien operator and is thus always discretized by a centered difference scheme.

**Attention:** TRUST allows the user to neglect the operator contribution. This can be done by using the C++ alias `Negligeable` in the concevtion and/or diffusion bloc.

### Finite Volume Difference (VDF) Schemes

- **Upwind scheme**

	The C++ alias is `Amont`. This is a first order upwind scheme.

- **Centered scheme**

	The C++ aliases are either `Centre` or `Centre4`. They correspond respectively to a second and fourth order cetered schemes.

- **QUICK scheme**

	The C++ alias is `Quick`. This is the third order Quadratic Upstream Interpolation for Convective Kinematics (Quick) scheme.

### Finite Element Volume (VEF) Schemes

- **Upwind scheme**

	The C++ alias is `Amont`. This is a first order upwind scheme.

- **Centered scheme**

	The C++ aliases are either `Centre` or `KCentre`. This is a second order cetered scheme.

- **QUICK scheme**

	The C++ alias is `KQuick`. This is the third order Quadratic Upstream Interpolation for Convective Kinematics (Quick) scheme.
	
- **EF-Stab scheme**

	The C++ alias is `EF_Stab`. This scheme is an upwind/centered mixed schemes. The behavior is controlled by a parameter, alpha, where the scheme behaves as a pure upwind with alpha = 1 and centered with alpha = 0.
	
- **MUSCL scheme**

	The C++ alias is `Muscl`. This is the second order Monotonic Upstream-centered Scheme for Conservation Laws (MUSCL) scheme.

### PolyMAC-series Schemes

- **Upwind scheme**

	The C++ alias is `Amont`. This is a first order upwind scheme.

- **Centered scheme**

	The C++ alias is `Centre`. This is a second order cetered scheme.
	
- **EF-Stab scheme**

	The C++ alias is `EF_Stab`. This scheme is an upwind/centered mixed schemes. The behavior is controlled by a parameter, alpha, where the scheme behaves as a pure upwind with alpha = 1 and centered with alpha = 0.
