ijk_splitting
=============

**ijk_splitting**
-----------------
**Inherits from:** :ref:`ijk_splitting` 


Object to specify how the domain will be divided between processors in IJK discretization

Parameters are:

- **ijk_grid_geometry**  (*type:* :ref:`ijk_grid_geometry`) the grid that will be splitted

- **nproc_i**  (*type:* int) the number of processors into which we will divide the grid following the  I direction

- **nproc_j**  (*type:* int) the number of processors into which we will divide the grid following the  J direction

- **nproc_k**  (*type:* int) the number of processors into which we will divide the grid following the  K direction
