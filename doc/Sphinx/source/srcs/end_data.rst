End of the data file
====================

Solve
-----

Now that you have finished to specify all your computation parameters,
you may add the `"Solve" <TRUST_Reference_Manual.pdf#solve>`__ keyword
at the end of your data file, in order to solve your problem. You may
also add the **"End"** keyword to specify the end of your data file.

.. container:: center

| For more details, see the `Project Reference
  Manual <TRUST_Reference_Manual.pdf#solve>`__.
| You can see methods to run your data file in section `1.4 <#Run>`__.

.. _stopfile:

Stop a running calculation
--------------------------

Your calculation will automatically stop if it has reached:

-  the end of the calculation time,

-  the maximal allowed cpu time,

-  the maximal number of iterations or

-  the threshold of convergence.

| You may use the *my_data_file*\ **.stop** file, if you want to stop
  properly your running calculation (i.e. with all saves).
| When the simulation is running, you can see the "**0**" value in that
  file. To stop it, put a "**1**" instead of the "**0**" and at the next
  iteration the calculation will stop properly. When you donâ€™t change
  anything to that file, at the end of the calculation, you can see that
  it is writen "**Finished correctly**".

Save
----

**TRUST** makes automatic backups during the calculation. The unknowns
(velocity, temperature,...) are saved in:

-  one **.xyz** file, happening:

   -  at the end of the calculation,

   -  but, user may disable it with the specific keyword
      "`EcritureLectureSpecial
      0 <TRUST_Reference_Manual.pdf#ecriturelecturespecial>`__" added
      just before the **"Solve"** keyword.

-  one (or several in case of parallel calculation) **.sauv** files,
   happening:

   -  at the start of the calculation,

   -  at the end of the calculation,

   -  each 23 hours of CPU, to change it, uses
      **"periode_sauvegarde_securite_en_heure"** keyword (default value
      23 hours),

   -  user may also specify a time physical period with **"dt_sauv"**
      keyword,

   -  periodically using **"tcpumax"** keyword for which calculation
      stops after the specified time (default value :math:`10^{30}`),
      use it for calculation on CCRT/TGCC and CINES clusters for
      example.

| By default, the name for the **.sauv** files is
  **"filename_problemname.sauv"** for sequential calculation,
  **"filename_problemname_000n.sauv"** for parallel calculation (one per
  process). The format of theses files is binary and the files are
  completed during successive saves.
| You can change the behaviour using the following keywords just before
  the **solve** instruction:

.. container:: center

| with **"xyz"**: the **.xyz** file is written instead of the **.sauv**
  files.
| **Note** that, you can use **"sauvegarde_simple"** instead of
  **"sauvegarde"** where the .sauv or .xyz file is deleted before saves,
  in order to keep disk space:

.. container:: center

| For more details, see the `Project Reference
  Manual <TRUST_Reference_Manual.pdf#Pbbase>`__.

Resume
------

To resume your calculation, you may:

-  change your initial time, the new initial time will be the real final
   calculation time of the previous calculation (cf .err file),

-  change your final calculation time to the new wanted value and

-  add the following block just before the **"Solve"** keyword:

   .. container:: center

You can resume your calculation:

-  from .sauv file(s) (one file per process): you can only resume the
   calculation with the **same number of equations** on **the same
   number of processes**,

-  or from a .xyz file: here you can resume your calculation by
   **changing the number of equations solved** and/or with a **different
   number of processes**.

Instead of **"reprise"** keyword, you can use **"resume_last_time"**
where **tinit** is automatically set to the last time of saved files
(but you may change **tmax**):

.. container:: center

| For examples, see the `TRUST
  tutorial <TRUST_tutorial.pdf#save_restart>`__ and the `Project
  Reference Manual <TRUST_Reference_Manual.pdf#Pbbase>`__.
| **Note** that you can run a calculation with initial condition read
  into a save file (.xyz or .sauv) from a previous calculation using
  `Champ_Fonc_reprise <TRUST_Reference_Manual.pdf#champfoncreprise>`__
  or read a into a MED file with
  `Champ_Fonc_MED <TRUST_Reference_Manual.pdf#champfoncmed>`__.
